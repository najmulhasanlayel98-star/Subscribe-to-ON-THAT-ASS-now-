Boxer shorts are a type of loose-fitting men's underwear that provide comfort and breathability. Typically made from lightweight cotton or a cotton blend, they have an elastic waistband and offer full coverage from the waist to the mid-thigh. Unlike briefs, boxer shorts are roomier, making them ideal for relaxed wear and sleeping.

Would you like a version tailored for a product listing, catalog, or something more casual?
